# Alex Pham React Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

My previous website portfolio was boring and I wanted a change. It was running on Wordpress and I wanted to develop a new website from the ground up (i.e. no themes) to gain some experience.
As I want to go into front end development, this project was mainly to get me familiar with React. For a portfolio website, it may be overkill but I wanted to experiment and have fun.

## Project Status

The website is still in progress as seen below. Even after I finish the will probably be some tweaking.

## Demo

https://alex-pham.com/

## Built With
* Javascript (React)
* CSS (SCSS)
* HTML
* Hosted on Heroku (I may possibly migrating to DigitalOcean)
* Significant 3rd Party tools:
    * react-particles-js (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles-js)
        * I used this for the contact form
    * parallax.js (https://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/)
        * I used this for the moving clouds which hold my different skills
    * SVG logos (https://github.com/gilbarbara/logos)
        * I used this for many of the logos for different technologies in my skill section
    * Color Changing Background (https://codepen.io/alexzaworski/pen/mEkvAG)
        * I used this for the contact form
    * SweetAlert (https://sweetalert2.github.io/)
         * I used this for any modals
## Challenges
Through the development of my project I ran into a few challenges:

* I used a few 3rd party libraries to implement some parts of the website
    * I first struggled on using the Particles JS (for the initial cover background) as it was my first time using it. Looking back at it, it was worth the effor
    * I also struggled using Parallax JS (for the clouds), I still do struggle using it. Styling it was very difficult
* I struggle getting used to React syntax
    * I still juggle between using classes or functional components, I will probably choose to stick with functions in the future
    * I used little to no state in this app so I want to make use of this in a future project

## What I learnt

* How to use React (and 3rd party libraries) with following a tutorial
* How to deploy to Heroku
* Making use of SVGs
